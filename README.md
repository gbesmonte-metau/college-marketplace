Overview
Category: E-commerce
Story: Every year before summer starts, college students move out of their dorm. Many of them have to fly back home, carrying only their essentials. Some are in their last year. These students have to either donate, toss, or find a buyer for the items they no longer need. This app would allow them to easily list items that they no longer need.
Market: This app is aimed for college students that dorm.
Habit: This app may be used year-long, but has special emphasis when students are moving in and out of dorms (Fall/Spring).
Scope: College students can upload their items and images of those items. Buyers and sellers can chat in order to negotiate.

User Roles and Personas
Seller - a user that is selling something they will no longer use
Ben is a 22 year old college student that has completed his last year! He has an electric scooter he used for many years, but will not need it anymore. Ben would use the site to list his scooter, available for students at his college who may need it, on his phone, tablet, or computer. By using this app, Ben will not have to ask all his friends or go through the hassle of selling it to an outside market, he can just find someone who goes to the college. Potential pain points would be if Ben never finds a buyer for the scooter or if the buyers he finds are difficult to coordinate with.
Buyer- a user that is browsing the app for items they need
Sally has just finished her freshman year of college! She has her next semester planned out, and knows she needs a specific mathematics textbook for the class. Problem is, it is relatively new and costs around 100 dollars. Sally uses the app website to find the textbook that she needs from someone who has taken the class already, and is able to buy it for a cheaper price. Potential pain points would be if Sally could not find the book or if the seller was being difficult.
